# Building a data-rich Progressive Web App

This repo is designed to be a companion to my tutorial in the August 2019 issue of NET mag.

## Setup

I've tried this on node versions 9 and 12 without any issues. Getting up and running should be as simple as:

```
npm install
npm start
```

`parcel` handles all of the bundling as well as the local dev server with livereload. `json-server` provides us with a simple REST API for our contacts which we can edit in `db.json`. Both of these tasks are started when you run `npm start`.
