# Building a data-rich Progressive Web App

This repo is designed to be a companion to my tutorial in the August 2019 issue of NET mag.

## Setup

I've tried this on node versions 9 and 12 without any issues (Linux and Mac respectively). Getting up and running should be as simple as:

```
npm install
npm start
```

`parcel` handles all of the bundling as well as the local dev server with livereload. `json-server` provides us with a simple REST API for our contacts which we can edit in `db.json`. Both of these tasks are started when you run `npm start`.

## Following the tutorial

If you'd like to code along with the magazine tutorial, I suggest checkout out the `starting-point` branch. If you'd like to see the finishing state along with some extra comments explaining things, take a look at `master`.

As offline caching of a page has been covered in previous articles, for this project I've used [SW Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/) along with [parcel-plugin-sw-cache](https://github.com/mischnic/parcel-plugin-sw-cache) to have a simple cache of the project files that's updated when they change.

For following along the tutorial I recommend having "Update on reaload" and "Bypass for network" ticked in Chrome DevTools Application tab.
